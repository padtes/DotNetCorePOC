Files: NpsApyLite_columnList.txt 
 and Excel file NpsLite_Letter.xlsx (3 tabs)

-- all the columns including derived columns are here as .txt and 3rd tab of the  Excel

in the first and second tab, add 2 columns mapping a tag to data column
 - no need to put as {{ }} here for tag
 - some dummy sample I have added in tab-1

-- if a field is missing or if in doubt, please put a note 
   OR add what derived field is needed.

First tab I have extracted all the tags from the files Kishen gave me
I have actually used the column-B : preferred tag name and tried mapping most of the columns

PLEASE REVIEW and fill in the blanks / mark as duplicate (occur in more than one place) Or Correct as you wish.
